// Player match ratings (1.0 ..= 10.0) computed from a
// [`PlayerMatchEndStats`] snapshot. Build a context with
// [`RatingContext::new`] and call [`RatingContext::calculate`].
//
// The model has three moving parts and nothing else:
//
//   1. a **performance value** — each position group folds its stat
//      line into one signed number, in whatever units suit the role
//      (goals prevented for a keeper, goal-denominated contribution
//      for an outfielder);
//   2. a **scale** — that number standardised against the position's
//      own population mean and spread ([`PerformanceScale`]);
//   3. a **shape** — one curve, shared by every position, turning the
//      standardised score into a rating ([`RatingShape`]).
//
// Events a match report would lead with — an error that became a goal,
// a red card, an own goal — are applied as rating points *after* the
// shape, so a single catastrophe still reaches the disaster band
// instead of being compressed away with everything else.
//
// Splitting scale from shape is what makes the model hold its
// calibration. Component weights decide what counts as good; the scale
// decides what counts as normal; the shape decides how far off-normal
// moves the rating. Change a weight and only the first is affected —
// the population level is a property of the anchor alone.
//
// The rating never reads ability, current_ability, reputation or any
// hidden attribute. A player has a good rating because the match
// produced a good stat line for him. Everything about *who* he is
// belongs upstream, in what the engine lets him do.

// ── The shape ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// One curve for every position. It takes a **standardised** performance
// (see `PerformanceScale` below) — how many population standard
// deviations off the positional average this shift was — and returns a
// rating movement. Because the input is standardised, a forward's goal
// and a keeper's clean sheet arrive on the same scale even though one is
// worth four times the other in goals, which is what lets a single
// shape serve all four lines instead of four hand-tuned ladders that
// drift apart.
//
// Fitted to published reference ratings, in z units:
//
// ```text
//   z   reference performance                          rating
//  +3.5 forward hat-trick                                9.2
//  +2.3 forward brace / keeper seven-save shutout        8.4-8.7
//  +1.1 forward goal / keeper four-save shutout          7.3-7.5
//   0.0 ordinary shift                                   6.72
//  -0.6 goalless forward / keeper beaten by his one shot 6.3
//  -1.9 keeper who shipped three of four                 5.2
// ```
//
// Both exponents exceed 1, so the curve is flat through the middle: a
// shift half a deviation off average is not a performance, it is noise,
// and it should not move the rating much. That flat middle is what a
// hard-capped additive model cannot produce — its caps flatten the
// middle by clipping, which also flattens everything above the cap and
// leaves the distribution bimodal.
//
// The down limb is steeper than the up limb through the ordinary range
// (0.69 vs 0.63 at z = 1) and the up limb overtakes it past z ≈ 2. That
// is the real asymmetry of football judgement: mistakes are punished
// faster than merit is rewarded, but genuine brilliance still outruns
// everything.
