//! Goalkeeper match rating — a goals-prevented model.
//!
//! # Why this is not a save-volume model
//!
//! The rating a keeper deserves is not "how busy was he" but "how many
//! goals did he keep out that an ordinary keeper would have conceded".
//! Those two questions have opposite answers for the same keeper: a
//! keeper behind a bad defence faces more shots, so he makes more saves,
//! so a volume model pays him for the very thing that is going wrong.
//! Measured on a full 380-match season, the previous additive model
//! (`saves` up to +1.22, `workload` +0.48, and a save-count-gated
//! evidence tier worth another +0.8 at the boundary, against −0.16 for
//! the first goal conceded) produced a league where the keeper with 28
//! clean sheets and 0.37 goals against per game rated *identically* to
//! the keeper with 3 clean sheets and 2.26 — and where a 45-conceded
//! season out-rated the same player's 26-conceded season.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Everything hangs off one quantity, in units of goals:
//!
//! ```text
//!   expected_ga     = shots_on_target_faced · CONVERSION · difficulty
//!   goals_prevented = expected_ga − goals_conceded
//! ```
//!
//! Because `shots_faced == saves + conceded`, that expands to
//!
//! ```text
//!   goals_prevented = CONVERSION·saves − (1 − CONVERSION)·conceded
//! ```
//!
//! i.e. **a save is worth +0.34 of a goal and a concession costs −0.66**.
//! The two invariants a reader applies instinctively then hold by
//! construction, not by calibration:
//!
//!   * hold shots faced fixed, concede one more ⇒ the rating **always**
//!     falls (`monotonic_in_goals_conceded`);
//!   * hold goals conceded fixed, face one more shot ⇒ the rating
//!     **always** rises (`monotonic_in_shots_faced`).
//!
//! No arrangement of the remaining terms can break them, because the
//! remaining terms don't read save volume at all. That is the property
//! the old model lacked and the reason it had to be re-tuned every time
//! anything moved.
//!
//! # Why shot-stopping is not the whole rating
//!
//! `goals_prevented` divides through by workload by construction — the
//! expectation it subtracts is proportional to shots faced. That makes
//! it the right measure of *shot-stopping skill*, and the wrong measure
//! of a keeper's night on its own: a keeper behind a sieve is judged
//! against a sieve's expectation, so the extra goals cancel and the
//! rating stops reading the scoreline at all. Measured over a full
//! season it flattened the entire middle of the ladder — 0.79 goals
//! against per game rating *below* 1.66 — with a season spread of 0.20
//! where real keeper ratings spread ~0.55.
//!
//! So the performance is shot-stopping **plus** a smaller
//! [`DEFENSIVE_OUTCOME`] term that reads goals conceded against a
//! league-average night rather than against this keeper's own workload.
//! Both halves are needed and neither is sufficient: the first is what
//! separates a keeper from his defence, the second is what stops the
//! model pretending he is independent of it.
//!
//! A protected shutout (0 shots faced, 0 conceded) scores exactly zero
//! goals prevented and lands on the anchor — "did his job, nothing to
//! judge" — instead of needing the bespoke `dominant_defense` credit the
//! old model bolted on to rescue it.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! `performance` (goal units, compressed through the shared spread
//! shape) covers shot-stopping, command of the area, distribution and
//! the team result. `defining_moments` (rating units, applied *after*
//! the compression) covers the events a match report leads with — an
//! error that put the ball in the net, a flapped cross that became a
//! goal, a red card, a penalty given away. Those bypass the curve on
//! purpose: "solid apart from the howler that cost us" is a real verdict
//! and a compressed model can't produce it.
