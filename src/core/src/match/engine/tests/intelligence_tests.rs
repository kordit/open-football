//! Regression tests for the player-individuality / match-intelligence
//! rework (Sections 1–9). These pin the cross-cutting behaviours that
//! the unit tests in each helper module check from below — here we
//! check the end-to-end intent: elite first touch wins under pressure,
//! exhausted players degrade, traits change movement / passing, the
//! coach reads xG and territory, the substitution scoring picks the
//! right replacement, and the rating formula penalises errors / lifts
//! GKs by xG-prevented.
