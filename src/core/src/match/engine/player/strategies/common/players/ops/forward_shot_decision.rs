    // smart forward pulls the trigger on the right chance, not just any
    // chance. Composure and execution add some lift; the rest comes
    // from chance quality (xg_boost, clarity, body control, GK).
    //
    // Calibration target: ~13 shots/team/match (real PL average is
    // 12-14/team, top sides 16-18). Earlier slopes (0.22 / 0.10 / 0.12
    // + 0.06 base) produced mean willingness ~0.06 across the skill
    // distribution — strong teams logged 39 shots/match (~3× target)
    // and equal-skill matches 27/team (~2×). The trim flattens the
    // skill slope (so strong shooters are less aggressive per chance)
    // while bumping the base constant so weak shooters keep firing on
    // tap-in floors. Net per-shot conversion is preserved (xg_boost /
    // clarity / body_control still scale willingness); only the
    // per-tick fire rate drops, cutting shot volume to ~17/team at
    // equal skill and ~22/team for strong sides — matching real PL.
    // Calibration target: shots/team ~17 (engine-realistic, real PL ~13).
    // The engine has multiple shot paths (helper + corner headers +
    // midfielder cutbacks); the helper handles ~80% of shots. The
    // interception noise gate must stay in place (see
    // [[interception-load-bearing]]) — over-cutting interceptions
    // explodes goals via 28→62% on-target.
    //
    // Lever: BASE cut applies to every helper call regardless of xG
    // (line-balance neutral). xg_boost floor preferentially cuts
    // speculative shots — too aggressive on the floor hits FWDs more
    // than MIDs and breaks the 58/32/10 line ratio (FWDs take more
    // speculative shots). Iteration history (2026-06-05):
    //   G (base 0.012, xg_boost floor 0.20): goals 2.91, line 47/40/13
    //   H (base 0.018, xg_boost floor 0.42): goals 3.28, line 52/36/12
    //   I (base 0.012, xg_boost floor 0.30): aiming goals ~2.6, line 55/33/12
    // Halved across the board (0.013/0.045/0.020/0.025 → below) as the
    // volume half of the fatigue-normalization rebalance (2026-06-11).
    // FATIGUE_RATE_MULTIPLIER's order-of-magnitude correction stopped
    // outfielders from flatlining at the 15% condition floor by minute
    // 20 — which un-suppressed shot volume for the remaining 70 minutes
    // and pushed goals/match from 3.3 to 5.3. The willingness trim is
    // the memory-approved lever for shot volume (NOT the intercept
    // gate); halving restores ~18 shots/team while keeping the now-flat
    // xG/shot and goal-timing profile the fatigue fix bought.
    // Second trim pass (×0.78) after the condition-slope softening and
    // settle-window extension put goals at 3.41, then a final ×0.9 once
    // the 600-match validation read 2.97 — lands the total in the
    // 2.6-2.8 real band at ~18 shots/team.
    // Third trim (×0.85, 2026-06 regime-neutralization round): gating
    // score-reactive behavior to the final ~28 minutes un-suppressed
    // the first hour of play and lifted totals to 3.48 — this rebases
    // to ~2.9-3.0 at the new flat game-state profile.
    // Fourth trim (×0.80, condition/movement realism round): the
    // effort-based movement + fatigue rework (sprint occupancy 77%→10%,
    // FT condition ~45%→~70%) stopped outfielders losing their skill to
    // exhaustion, so they hold effective finishing/creation all match —
    // which re-inflated helper volume to 3.48 again. Volume is the
    // line-balance-neutral half of the rebalance (base cut only; xg_boost
    // floor untouched so the 58/32/10 share holds); the freshness gain
    // itself is realistic and kept.
    // Rescaled ~÷4 with the true-unit geometry correction: expanded
    // shooting ranges multiplied in-range polling time ~3x and the
    // corrected xG curve lifted xg_boost ~1.5x — without this cut the
    // engine produced 54 shots/team. The division lands on the BASE so
    // the skill terms keep their relative steepness (selection remains
    // the dominant chooser signal).
    // Restored ×1.08 (2026-08-08) after `DefensiveRecovery` put
    // defenders goal-side of the ball. Bodies between ball and goal
    // suppress shooting through the defer / clarity gates, and team shot
    // volume fell 13.5 → 12.7 per match against a real ~13.4 — the
    // engine had lost shots it should still be taking, not shots it
    // should never have had. Applied to every term so the skill slope
    // keeps its shape (selection stays the dominant chooser signal) and
    // the 58/32/10 line balance is untouched, which a floor change
    // would not have been.
    //
    // This recovers the VOLUME half of the goals drop only. Measured
    // decomposition of 2.45 → 2.17: roughly 0.13 from shot volume and
    // 0.15 from save% moving 67.2% → 69.6%. That second half is
    // deliberately NOT chased — 69.6% is the real-football value and
    // 67.2% was the engine sitting below it, so the defending fix moved

    // — and at the previous coefficients the same rate put 21.4 shots a
