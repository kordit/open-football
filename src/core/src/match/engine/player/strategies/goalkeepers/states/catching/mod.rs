/// Length of the save window, in AI ticks, that `per_tick_save` spreads a
/// per-SHOT save probability across. Get this wrong and the keeper's
/// realised save rate drifts away from `save_probability` even though
/// that model is untouched: the per-tick die is rolled once per tick the
/// keeper spends in the save, so a longer window compounds to a higher
/// cumulative save rate.
///
/// Was 3.0, derived when the loose-ball override could yank a keeper out
/// of `Catching` / `Diving` part-way through a save. Keepers now hold
/// those states to completion (see `PlayerState::is_committed_action`),
/// so the real window is longer and the constant that described it was
/// stale. 3.8 is the re-derived length.
///
/// NB this state-machine save roll is the minor of the two save paths —
/// the dominant one is the per-tick physics check in
/// `Ball::try_save_shot`, and that is where the population save rate was
/// actually recalibrated. Measured on its own, moving this constant
/// 3.0 → 3.8 was within run-to-run noise; it is corrected because it is
/// now the honest number, not because it moved the aggregate.
/// CORRECTED 3.8 → 38: the early-return at the top of `process`
/// holds the keeper in Catching for the ENTIRE shot flight, so the
/// per-shot→per-tick conversion was dividing by a residency ~10x
/// shorter than the real one and the save was rolled 30-110 times.
/// That made this the DOMINANT save path (population save% sat at
/// 77.7% vs real 67% even after the physics roll was latched to one
/// roll per shot) and made every `skill_mult` retune inert.
/// LEFT AT 54 after the 2026-08 possession fix, deliberately. Shots now
/// stay live for their projected flight rather than a flat 40 ticks, so
/// the keeper's residency here did grow and the population save rate rose
/// with it (79.7% against a real ~67%). Re-deriving the constant upward
/// was tried and REVERTED: 54 → 75 → 110 cut the save rate as expected
/// but did not add a single goal, because the shots the keeper stops
/// catching were not goal-bound — they miss instead. All it moved was the
/// engine's on-target rate, which is defined as (saves + goals) and so
/// falls one-for-one with saves. 54 measures on-target at 33.5% against a
/// real 33%; 75 gives 29.4% and 110 gives 24.3%, for the same goals.
/// Treat the save-rate gap as a symptom of the keeper collecting shots
/// that were missing anyway, not as a lever on the scoreline.
