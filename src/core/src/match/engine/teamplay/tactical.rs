//! Team-level tactical state shared by all eleven players on a side.
//!
//! The per-player state machines (defenders, midfielders, forwards, GK)
//! used to evaluate ball/opponent proximity from scratch every tick and
//! produced "eleven independent agents" behaviour. Real football runs
//! off team-level phases — build-up, progression, attack, transition,
//! settled defence — that every player reads and respects. This module
//! defines that shared layer; it is recomputed periodically from the
//! ball/possession/time signals and consulted by player states when
//! they make branching decisions.
//!
//! All compute helpers are associated functions on `TeamTacticalState`
//! (or `BallZone` / `BallSideZone`) — there are no loose helper
//! functions in this module. Keeping the math attached to the type
//! makes the calculator boundary obvious from a `cargo doc` view.
