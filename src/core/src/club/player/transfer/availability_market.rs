//! Market-discovery state for a *signed* player who is available to leave
//! his club — transfer-listed (`Lst`), has handed in a request (`Req`),
//! is unhappy (`Unh`), or is loan-listed (`Loa`).
//!
//! This is the signed-side mirror of [`super::free_agent_market`]. The
//! free-agent model answers "why is this clubless player still
//! unsigned?"; this one answers "why has the market not bitten on this
//! available, contracted player?". Both carry a durable per-player
//! block-reason so the long-sit diagnosis survives across ticks, and
//! both feed a softening curve (the seller drops the asking price, the
//! player relaxes his wage demand) as the failed weeks accumulate.
//!
//! The market-exposure *scoring* lives in
//! [`crate::transfers::pipeline::exposure`]; this module owns only the
//! durable state and the reason taxonomy, exactly as `free_agent_market`
//! owns `FreeAgentMarketState` / `FreeAgentBlockReason` while the matcher
