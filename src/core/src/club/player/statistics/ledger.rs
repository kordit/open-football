//! Canonical ledger types for player career and competition statistics.
//!
//! The ledger is the homogeneous shape every projection consumes —
//! independent of where the underlying data physically lives. Storage
//! writes append ledger entries directly (idempotent merge on the
//! `(season, team, kind, is_loan)` key); the projection reads them
//! into [`PlayerHistoryRow`] / [`PlayerCompetitionStatsRow`].
//!
//! Types live in their own module so [`super::history`] can hold a
//! `Vec<PlayerStatLedgerEntry>` without dragging in the projection
//! impl and creating a module cycle.
