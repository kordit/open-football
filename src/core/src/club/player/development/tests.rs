// XI, win the league reputation lottery, hire an elite coach, and the
// kid would touch world-class CA inside two seasons. The new tick uses
// load + maturity + soft per-week caps so that

//   * exposure that overshoots the optimal monthly minute band turns
//     negative,
//   * a youth at the wrong level (overmatched in a top league) learns
//     less, not more,
//   * stacked positive multipliers can't compound past a soft cap, and
//   * the step-up bonus does not fire for under-16s and is tiny for 17s.
//
// Each test below pins one of these guarantees so a future tweak that
