//! Per-player rolling workload, recovery debt, and form rating.
//!
//! Feeds squad rotation, injury risk, and form-based morale. Two concepts
//! coexist by design:
//!
//! * **Minutes** — raw competitive time (kept for backwards-compatibility
//!   and friendly-vs-competitive bookkeeping).
//! * **Physical load** — minutes weighted by position group, intensity,
//!   and post-drain condition. A 90-min keeper and a 90-min wingback
//!   carry very different physical loads.
//!
//! `physical_load_7` and `physical_load_30` are exponentially decayed in
//! the same shape as the minute windows so the struct stays compact and
//! `daily_decay()` remains a single hot path. `recovery_debt` accumulates
//! from heavy sessions and bleeds off with rest/recovery work — the
//! "deeper than condition" tiredness scouts and physios talk about.
//!
//! All new fields default to zero, so old saves and freshly-built
//! players load with a clean slate.
//!
//! Scale notes:
//! * 1.0 unit of physical_load ≈ 1 minute of a center-back at neutral
//!   intensity. A 90-min full-back tops out around 100, a 90-min keeper
//!   around 40. ACWR ratios above ~1.5 are the sports-science danger
//!   zone.
//! * `recovery_debt` is in the same "minute-equivalent" scale so it
//!   decays at the same rate. A heavy match adds 40-80; recovery
//!   sessions burn it back down.
