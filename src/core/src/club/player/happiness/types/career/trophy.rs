//! Trophy-win explanation payload — carried alongside `TrophyWon` and

//! competition the player just won, summarise how involved they were in
//! the campaign (apps / starts / sub apps / goals / assists / clean
//! sheets), and flag whether they made the final.
//!
//! Storing this on the event (rather than reconstructing it from cup
//! stats at render time) makes the event self-contained: by the time
//! the UI renders it, the player may have moved clubs, the cup season
//! may have rolled over, or their per-competition cup stats may have
//! been snapshotted — none of which can corrupt the original moment.

/// Which silverware the player just won. Lets the renderer pick
/// competition-specific copy ("Won the FA Cup" vs "Won the league
/// title") without parsing the event type.
