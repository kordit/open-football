//! Manager ↔ Player interaction history.
//!
//! Where the old code only stored "we had a talk and morale moved by X",
//! the interaction record keeps the *why* and *what* of every coach
//! conversation: which staff member, which topic, which tone, what the
//! player's mood was going in, and what came out the other side
//! (kept/broken promise, relationship delta, morale delta, cooldown).
//!
//! Why this is "beyond FM": you can audit the dressing room — which
//! topics keep getting raised, which manager keeps overpromising, which
//! player keeps being told the same thing. The new manager-talk
//! processing reads this history to apply per-(player,topic) cooldowns,
//! detect overpromise patterns, and refuse to repeat a talk that just
//! went badly.
