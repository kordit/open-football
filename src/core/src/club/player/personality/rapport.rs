//! Coach ↔ Player rapport — a thing FM only implies but never shows.
//!
//! Every player tracks a rapport score with each coach who has trained
//! them recently. High rapport amplifies training gains and team-talk
//! impact; low rapport means the coach has lost the player.
//!
//! Why this is "beyond FM":
//! - Rapport is **explicit and persistent**. You can see exactly which
//!   players vibe with which coaches.
//! - It **decays without contact** — a coach that isn't actively training
//!   a player drifts back toward neutral over months.
//! - It **asymmetrically responds** to good/bad events: a bad team-talk
//!   costs more rapport than a good one earns, mirroring real dressing
//!   rooms where trust is hard to build and easy to lose.
//!
//! The struct lives on `Player` so we don't have to store an N×M matrix
//! in a central place. Typical players have 1–3 rapport entries (head
//! coach, assistant, specialist).
