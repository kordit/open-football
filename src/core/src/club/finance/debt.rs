//! Club debt, insolvency, and administration.
//!
//! The previous model charged 0.6–1.5% *per month* on whatever the cash
//! balance happened to be, added the interest straight back onto that same
//! balance, and charged it again next month. Nothing capped it and nothing
//! ever resolved it: there was no bankruptcy, no owner bailout, no
//! restructuring. A club that dipped into the red compounded at 7–20% a
//! year forever, which is how clubs reached balances of minus one and a half
//! billion — a number no football club has ever approached because in
//! reality something always intervenes first.
//!
//! This module supplies the interventions, in the order a real club meets
//! them:
//!
//! 1. **Overdraft.** Debt inside an agreed facility is ordinary borrowing at
//!    an ordinary rate.
//! 2. **Owner injection.** Past the facility, a solvent owner puts money in
//!    rather than watch the club fail. Wealth and risk appetite decide how
//!    much and how willingly.
//! 3. **Emergency measures.** No transfer spending, forced wage reduction,
//!    players listed. The club is trading its way out.
//! 4. **Administration.** The terminal state: a points deduction, a transfer
//!    embargo, and a write-down of the unpayable debt to something the club
//!    can actually service. Painful and slow to exit — but finite.
