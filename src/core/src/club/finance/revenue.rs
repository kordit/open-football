//! Club revenue model.
//!
//! Every income line here is **continuous** in the club's inputs. The
//! previous model looked revenue up from a six-bucket `ReputationLevel`
//! ladder, so slipping one tier cut broadcast income 60% and commercial
//! income 70% in a single month, with no corresponding fall in the wage
//! bill. That cliff — not any one bad season — is what turned a mid-table
//! slump into an unrecoverable spiral: revenue collapsed, the deficit
//! widened, debt interest compounded, and the club could never buy its way
//! back out.
//!
//! The three lines model how football money actually arrives:
//!
//! * **Broadcast** is a *league* pool, not a club property. Everyone in a
//!   division draws from the same pot — an equal share, a merit payment on
//!   final position, and a facility fee for being televised often. A club
//!   whose reputation dips still banks its division's money. Relegation is
//!   cushioned by parachute payments, exactly as it is in reality.
//! * **Matchday** is capacity × utilisation × price. Capacity is a physical
//!   property of the club ([`ClubFacilities::stadium_capacity`]); only
//!   utilisation responds to form and standing.
//! * **Commercial** (sponsorship and merchandising) follows a smooth cubic
//!   in reputation — the one line that *should* track prestige closely,
//!   because shirt and sponsor money genuinely does.
