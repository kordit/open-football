//! Tuning constants & scale helpers for the academy system.

//! type rather than a soup of free helpers. The struct layout is:

//!   * `AcademyTuning` — knobs (intake month, target sizes, PA thresholds).
//!   * `AcademyTier`   — 1..10 short-scale tier derived from a 1..20
//!                       facility rating. Owns every formula that
//!                       needs "how strong is this academy" on the
//!                       short scale (norm, readiness threshold,
//!                       sessions-per-phase, …).

/// Half-open size bands the academy aims to keep itself inside, indexed
