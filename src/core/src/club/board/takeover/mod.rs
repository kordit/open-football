//! Rare ownership-change events. A club whose owner wants out (high
//! `exit_pressure`) under financial strain — or a rapidly rising club that
//! becomes an attractive asset — can attract a takeover. Rumours simmer
//! for a few months, then either complete (new, usually wealthier owner,
//! fresh strategy) or collapse (instability, short budget freeze).
//!
//! All decisions are driven by explicit inputs plus a caller-supplied
//! `roll` (0-99) so the engine stays deterministic and testable; the board
//! feeds it `IntegerUtils::random(0, 100)` in production.
