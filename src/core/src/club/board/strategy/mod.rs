//! priority drives the facility review, manager autonomy gates how much
//! the board overrides recruitment, and review frequency controls how
//! often confidence is re-judged.

/// The kind of squad the board wants assembled. Read by transfer
/// governance to bias which incoming players are welcomed or blocked.
