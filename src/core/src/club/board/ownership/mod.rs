//! Ownership model — who actually owns the club and how they exercise
//! power. This sits *alongside* the legacy `ChairmanProfile` (which keeps
//! `ambition`, `patience`, and `manager_loyalty` for backward-compatible
//! callers) and adds the richer governance knobs a real board needs:
//! wealth, interference, risk appetite, and exit pressure.
//!
//! Every field here feeds at least one downstream calculation — budget
//! sizing, transfer governance, facility approvals, pressure response, or
//! takeover behaviour. Nothing is inert.

/// Who owns the club. Each archetype biases governance differently:
/// member-owned clubs answer to supporters, state-backed owners chase
/// trophies regardless of cash, private equity obsesses over resale.
