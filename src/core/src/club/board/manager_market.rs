//! Manager market — shortlists, candidate scoring, and (in slice C)
//! poaching.
//!
//! When a club's seat opens up (board sacks the incumbent or contract
//! lapses), `ClubBoard.manager_search_since` is set to today. From that
//! tick onward the world-level manager-market phase
//! (`simulator.rs` Phase D) refreshes the club's `manager_shortlist`
//! once a week, ranking the candidates the board is willing to
//! consider.
//!
//! The module is partitioned into focused namespaces — every helper
//! lives as a method on the type that owns its concern:
//!   * `ManagerMarketTick`       — daily orchestrator + appointment phase
//!   * `ManagerSearch`           — `ClubBoard` search-state operations
//!   * `ManagerSeat`             — main-team head-coach-seat operations
//!   * `ManagerShortlist`        — shortlist building (free agents +
//!                                 employed targets) and shared limits
//!   * `ManagerCandidateScorer`  — pure scoring / acceptance predicates
//!   * inherent impl on `ManagerApproach` — poaching state machine
