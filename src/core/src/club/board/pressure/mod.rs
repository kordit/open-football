//! Supporter / media / dressing-room / financial / regulatory pressure.
//!
//! Pressure is a set of slow-moving 0-100 gauges that the board reads as
//! *inputs* to confidence and meetings — it colours decisions without
//! dictating them. A reckless rich owner shrugs off a fan revolt; a
//! member-owned club lurches at the first derby defeat. The owner's
//! `supporter_sensitivity` scales how much supporter/media heat actually
//! lands on board confidence.

/// Surfaced by the season's narrative so the board reacts to *stories*,
