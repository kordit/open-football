//! The club's own diary — dated things that happened to the institution
//! rather than to one of its players.
//!
//! Everything else the press reads is either a fact it can recompute
//! (the table, a scoreline, a squad list) or an entry in a player's own
//! event feed. The club's week has neither: a sacking leaves behind an
//! empty seat, a takeover leaves behind a different owner, and a
//! stadium expansion leaves behind a bigger number. All three are
//! *states*, and a state cannot tell a paper **when** it changed.
//!
//! That gap produced the system's oldest dugout bug. The only signal
//! the boardroom desk had was the squad-wide `ManagerDeparture` /
//! `NewManagerBounce` pair, fired whenever the head-coach id moved. A
//! sacking moves it twice — once when the caretaker steps up, once when
//! the permanent appointment lands a month later — so the paper ran
//! "part company with the manager" and "new man in the dugout" side by
//! side on both Mondays, and could not have said which of the two
//! actually happened, nor whether he was sacked, poached, or promoted
//! from within.
//!
//! So the club keeps a short log instead. Each entry is written at the
//! moment the thing happens, by the code that does it, and carries the
//! date and the people involved. The desks read the week's entries and
//! nothing else — no state scraping, no inference, and no story that
//! cannot say when it happened.
