//! Team-wide social weather — the single 0..100 number every downstream
//! system (training, match performance, board mood) reads when it wants
//! to know "is the dressing room a happy one?".
//!
//! Built once per weekly tick. The per-player [`crate::Relations`]
//! recalculation still produces a per-player chemistry score that's
//! useful as a local read, but the **squad** is a different object:
//! it owns squad-wide signals (captain, leadership core, manager
//! trust, recent turnover, integration) that any single
//! [`crate::Relations`] instance can't see. This snapshot rolls those
//! signals up so the answer is consistent across players.
//!
//! Why a separate type, not just an extra field on
//! `ChemistryContext`: ChemistryContext is **input** to the per-player
//! chemistry recalc. The snapshot is the **team-level output** —
//! downstream consumers should read it directly rather than averaging
//! 22 per-player chemistry numbers (those each carry their own
//! per-relation noise). Keeping the team number and the per-player
//! number on different stores makes their meanings unambiguous.
