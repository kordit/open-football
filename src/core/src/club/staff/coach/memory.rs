//! Persistent per-coach memory of player observations.
//!
//! Stored on [`Staff::coach_memory`] and updated at the post-match
//! dispatch layer (where the head coach for the side is known). The
//! memory is the coach's *interpretation* of a body of work — not a
//! replica of `PlayerStatistics`. The same matches feed both, but each
//! coach reads them through their own perception lens and personality,
//! so two coaches running the same player will form different memories.
//!
//! All fields default cleanly. A freshly-generated coach with no
//! observations behaves neutrally — every memory read either returns
//! `None` (no record) or a record where the EMAs are seeded to the
//! first match's rating, the streaks are zero, and the trust signals
//! sit at the neutral baseline (0.5). The selection / substitution
//! callers all have a "no memory" fall-back that defers to the existing
//! score, so old saves and freshly-built staff load without surprise.
