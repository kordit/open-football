//! The coach's standing intention for each player in his squad.
//!
//! Everything the coach layer did before this was a *reaction*: a
//! per-fixture strategy, a per-match memory update, a signed nudge folded
//! into one selection. Nothing anywhere recorded what the coach actually
//! meant to do with a man over a season — who he was building around, who
//! he was grooming, whose competition the domestic cup was, and who he had
//! simply stopped counting on. So the squad had no shape and no direction:
//! each week's team was re-derived from ability and form, and a player's
//! standing never changed except as an accident of those two.
//!
//! [`CoachSquadPlan`] is that missing intention, held on the coach (not
//! the player) because it is his opinion, revised monthly and on his
//! arrival — a new manager really does tear up his predecessor's plan.
//!
//! It is deliberately a PLAN, not a mechanism: nothing here moves a
//! player. Consumers read it and decide — selection gives the cup keeper
//! his competition, the renewal desk declines to re-sign a man who is not
//! in the plans, the listing desk knows who is in the shop window. That
//! keeps the plan honest and removable: with an empty plan every consumer
//! falls back to exactly the behaviour it had before.
