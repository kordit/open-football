//! Weekly Player of the Week selection and history.
//!
//! Each non-friendly league picks one winner per calendar week from the
//! match results played in the previous seven days. The pick is computed
//! Mondays from `League::matches` (the per-league `MatchStorage`) so
//! teams that drew, were rested, or skipped a fixture still contribute.
//!
//! ## Scoring
//! Per match the player appeared in:
//! ```text
//!   contribution = max(rating - 6.0, 0.0).min(4.0)
//!                + goals * 1.5
//!                + assists * 0.8
//!                + (motm ? 1.5 : 0.0)
//!                + (clean_sheet_for_back_line ? 0.5 : 0.0)
//!                + (team_won ? 0.3 : 0.0)
//! ```
//! Multiple appearances stack with a small multi-match bump
//! (`1 + 0.2 * (n - 1)`) so a player who featured twice in a week edges
//! out a one-match performance of equivalent quality.
//!
//! Tiebreak: total score → highest single-match rating → lower id.
