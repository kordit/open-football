//! End-of-season playoff for a grouped competition (MLS Cup, the Argentine
//! Torneo Apertura/Clausura finals, Serie C promotion playoff, …).
//!
//! A `LeaguePlayoff` crowns a champion across the several round-robin
//! groups that make up one competition. The regular season runs as N
//! independent group tables — exactly as before — and when the relevant
//! stage of every group is finished, the top `qualifiers_per_group` of
//! each group are seeded into a knockout bracket per the competition's
//! [`PlayoffFormat`]:
//!
//! * [`PlayoffFormat::SingleElimination`] — generic: group seeds are
//!   interleaved into one field and re-paired strongest-vs-weakest each
//!   round, byes to top seeds (the pre-2026 behaviour).
//! * [`PlayoffFormat::CrossGroupBracket`] — Argentine Primera: the zones
//!   cross immediately (1°A vs 8°B, 2°B vs 7°A, …) in a fixed bracket
//!   tree; the better seed hosts every round; the final is nominally
//!   neutral (modelled with the better seed as home side).
//! * [`PlayoffFormat::MlsCup`] — per-conference brackets: a single-game
//!   wild card (8 v 9), a best-of-3 round one (1 v WC, 4 v 5, 2 v 7,
//!   3 v 6), single-game conference semifinals and finals, then a single
//!   cross-conference final hosted by the better regular-season record.
//!   The best overall regular-season record also takes the Supporters'
//!   Shield, recorded on the playoff itself.
//!
//! Split-season competitions (Argentine Apertura/Clausura) get TWO
//! playoffs — one per tournament ([`PlayoffStage::FirstStage`] /
//! [`PlayoffStage::SecondStage`]), each triggered by its own tournament's
//! completion and crowning its own champion.
//!
//! Like [`crate::league::DomesticCup`], the playoff drives its fixtures
//! through an inner `League` (`is_cup = true`) so it reuses the match
//! engine, per-match stat/morale/discipline fan-out, slug indexing and the
//! web layer.
