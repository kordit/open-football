//! Domestic knockout cup (FA Cup, Copa del Rey, Coppa Italia, …).
//!
//! A `DomesticCup` is the core crate's own representation of a country's
//! club cup. It lives on `Country::domestic_cup`, *outside* the standings
//! `LeagueCollection`, so the league programme stays purely round-robin.
//!
//! The cup drives its fixtures through an inner `League` (`is_cup = true`,
//! `friendly = false`) so it transparently reuses the match engine, the
//! per-match stat / morale / discipline / reputation fan-out
//! (`LeagueResult::process_local`), slug indexing and the web layer — all
//! of which key off `League`. What this wrapper adds on top is the
//! knockout-specific behaviour the round-robin scheduler can't express:
//! a progressively drawn single-leg bracket with byes for the top seeds.
