//! Year-round performance-breakout watch — the one talent watch a club
//! runs, over everything its scouting network can see.
//!
//! The demand-driven scout pipeline and the listed-star sweep only run
//! inside a transfer window, so a player whose *form* is outrunning his
//! level — a 22-year-old striker top-scoring a second division — could sit
//! for months with zero interest and zero scout monitoring simply because
//! the window was shut and his club had merely loan-listed him.
//!
//! This pass closes that hole. Weekly, regardless of the window, it surfaces
//! genuine breakouts to plausible buyers as **scout monitoring** plus a
//! staff recommendation — the club puts the player on its books and its
//! recruitment department argues for him. It never starts a negotiation:
//! those stay window-gated, so the recorded interest flows through the
//! normal recommendation / meeting / shortlist path once the window opens.
//!
//! The watch covers the whole world through one lens. Candidates come from
//! this country's rosters AND from the shared world snapshot, and every one
//! passes the same gates; what differs is only what a scout can observe
//! from where he stands. A home candidate is corroborated — scoring-chart
//! standing, awards, availability state, a read on his character. A
//! foreigner is judged on the bare output and rating his market summary
//! carries, a strictly harder read. And on the buyer's side the club's
//! scouting NETWORK bounds what it sees at all: reach widens continuously
//! with reputation, so a giant's watch covers the world while a minnow's
//! stops at its own border.
//!
//! Realism is identical to the in-window sweep: the same
//! [`evaluate_listed_target`] gates (tier window, affordability, wage
//! headroom, reputation plausibility, squad need / upgrade / resale) plus the
//! staged [`TransferPlausibilityBuilder`] veto run here — only with
//! `form_discovery_mode`, so a not-yet-listed breakout can be discovered on
//! form rather than on a for-sale sign. A flat-track scorer in a weak division
//! is league-rep discounted inside the breakout signal and so never clears the
//! bar; a top club still won't monitor a player who is no upgrade, no resale
//! prospect, and fills no need.
//!
//! Youth squads are covered too. Their matches are friendly-classified, so a
//! youngster's output lives in his `friendly_statistics` and his age-group
//! "league" carries no senior reputation. For a youth team the watch reads the
//! friendly bucket and scores it undiscounted
//! ([`crate::transfers::pipeline::breakout::LeaguePerformanceLookup::breakout_for_youth`]),
//! so an academy standout — an U18 banging in goals — surfaces to plausible
//! clubs as scout monitoring instead of staying invisible behind a
//! zero-reputation age-group league.
//!
//! Per project convention this is a method on [`PipelineProcessor`]; every
//! type is reached through a `use` at the file header.
