//! Recruitment department types — the shared dossier that scouts,
//! the chief scout, and the recruitment meeting all read and write.
//!
//! Lives in its own module rather than `mod.rs` to keep that file's
//! domain inventory small. The flow is:
//!
//! 1. A `ScoutingAssignment` triggers the creation/update of a
//!    `ScoutPlayerMonitoring` row tying a specific scout to a player.
//! 2. Each subsequent observation refreshes the row's confidence,
//!    role-fit, and risk flags.
//! 3. Once weekly the recruitment meeting walks all `ReportReady`
//!    monitorings, collects scout votes, and produces
//!    `RecruitmentMeeting` records that gate downstream shortlist /
//!    board behaviour.
//!
//! Nothing here is hidden CA/PA — assessment fields are the same
//! visible-skill estimates the rest of the scouting pipeline uses.
//!
//! All types are `Clone` because the simulation occasionally clones
//! club transfer plans for diagnostics, and `Debug` for log output.
