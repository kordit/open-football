//! Country-pair transfer route policy. Centralises the real-world
//! political / sporting frictions the simulation honours so the rest
//! of the transfer machinery can defer to one source of truth. Today
//! the only entries are:
//!
//!   * Russia ↔ Ukraine moves (loan or permanent) halted from
//!     2022-02-24 onwards. The simulation treats this as a closed
//!     route — neither AI nor stale-negotiation paths may complete
//!     such a transfer past the cutoff.
//!   * Russian clubs barred from continental (UEFA) competition from
//!     2022-02-28 onwards, the date FIFA and UEFA announced their
//!     joint suspension of Russian clubs and national teams. A
//!     Russian club cannot satisfy a `WantsEuropeanCompetition`
//!     desire even at elite reputation.
//!
//! Lookups are tiny and pure. Country codes are 2-letter ISO
//! lowercase (`ru`, `ua`) — matching `Country::code` produced by the
//! database layer. Callers always pass the current sim date so the
//! policy is automatically inert in pre-2022 saves (no special-casing
//! historical leagues at the call site).
//!
//! Designed to grow: future political / federation suspensions can
//! add their own date-windowed predicate without rewiring callers.
