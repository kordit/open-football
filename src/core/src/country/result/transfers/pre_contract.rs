//! Pre-contract (Bosman) staging for the country transfer market.
//!
//! Real clubs don't wait for a useful player to become an unattached free
//! agent — once he's inside the final months of an expiring deal and his
//! club clearly won't keep him, a rival agrees a *pre-contract*: a free
//! transfer signed now, effective the day the current contract lapses.
//! The player is NOT moved early; he plays out his deal, then the expiry
//! pass in `handle_free_agents` routes the free move to the agreed club
//! instead of dropping him into the open pool.
//!
//! This module owns the *staging* half — deciding who gets pre-signed by
//! whom and on what terms — and stamps a [`PreContractAgreement`] onto the
//! player. Execution lives in `free_agents.rs`
//! (`collect_pre_contract_signings`), which reuses the ordinary in-country
//! free-agent signing path.
//!
//! Domestic-only for now: the buyer is always a club in the same country,
//! so the move executes through `execute_transfer_within_country`. A
//! cross-border Bosman would need the deferred cross-country queue and is
//! left for later.
