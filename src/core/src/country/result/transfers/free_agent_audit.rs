//! Audit / debug layer for the free-agent market. Answers the question
//! the matcher itself can't: *why is this long-term free agent still
//! unsigned?* — by combining the player's durable market state (days
//! free, pressure, offers, last block reason) with a live world scan
//! of who could even buy them (eligible countries / clubs / matching
//! requests under the same gates the matcher runs).
//!
//! Read-only: nothing here mutates the market. The monthly
//! `log_long_term` hook gives the simulation log one explanatory line
//! per 12-month-plus free agent when debug logging is enabled.
